# Cars Dataset

```{r}

summary(cars)

```

This dataset contains information about speed and stopping distance of cars. The data was collected in the 1920's. It has 50 rows and two variables.

# Plot of Pressure Dataset

```{r}
#| fig-align: "center"
 
# Initial Code:
# plot(pressure, xlab = "Temperature [\u00B0C]", ylab = "Pressure [mmHg]")
# title(main = "Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature")

# Revised Code:
plot(pressure, xlab = "Temperature [\u00B0C]", ylab = "Pressure [mmHg]")
title(main = "Vapor Pressure of Mercury as a Function of Temperature", sub = "Figure 1-1")

```

Note: The code-chunk option `#| fig-align: "center"` was used to specify that the above plot would be center-aligned.
